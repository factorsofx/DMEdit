# DMEdit
Attempts to improve upon FastDMM by not having shitcode and actually
being usable. Ultimate goal is to be better than DreamMaker itself.

## Capabilities (Current)
 - Object Tree Parser
 - Rudimentary syntax highlighting and code folding
 
## Capabilities (Planned)
In no particular order...
 - Map Editing
 - Autocomplete, usable find/replace
 - DME integration (auto-includes)
 - DMI editing
 - Integration with BYOND
 - Integration with Git
 - SS13-specific mapping tools (pipes, wires, etc)
 - Dark and light themes
 - Addons or something?
 
## Building
DMEdit uses Gradle for building and dependency management.

Any suggestions for a better name should be given.
